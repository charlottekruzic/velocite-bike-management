VeloCitÃ© is a bike-sharing management system designed to handle bike rentals and maintenance across multiple city stations. The system comprises several integrated components including stations, bikes, subscribers, and a central registry to efficiently manage the entire rental lifecycle.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project objectives

- **Test-driven development**: Write tests before implementing code to ensure all functionality adheres to requirements
- **Integration testing**: Verify seamless interaction between system components
- **Continuous integration**: Implement CI workflows to maintain code quality and facilitate team collaboration
- **Design pattern implementation**: Utilize Singleton, Factory, Decorator and other patterns to create maintainable, scalable code
- **Functional testing**: Validate system behavior under real-world scenarios
- **GUI testing**: Implement automated testing with Selenium for the user interface
- **Collaborative development**: Establish effective team workflows using Git, GitHub, and GitHub Actions

## ðŸ§© Core components

- **Stations**: Handle bike rental and return operations
- **Bikes**: Represent available bicycles, including status tracking and feature options
- **Subscribers**: Manage user profiles and rental history
- **Registry**: Track all rental transactions and returns
- **City**: Coordinate interactions between stations, bikes, and subscribers
- **Operator ("Exploitant")**: Manage maintenance scheduling and bike redistribution
- **GUI**: Provide user interface for system interaction

## ðŸ“œ Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
- Maven for dependency management and build automation
- IntelliJ IDEA (recommended) or another Java IDE
- Git for version control
- Selenium for GUI testing

## ðŸŽ“ Academic Context
This project was developed during our Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Science at the University of Franche ComtÃ©, across 11 practical sessions. 

Problem statements for each session are not included in the repository, but can be provided upon request.
